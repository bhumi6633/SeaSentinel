The Marine Conservation Society faces challenges in maintaining accurate, real-time temperature monitoring of marine environments, which is critical for assessing climate impact and biodiversity health. Precise temperature data is essential for identifying abnormal trends in water temperature, which can cause coral bleaching, disrupt marine species, and affect fish populations. Without effective monitoring, conservation efforts are hindered, and critical responses to environmental changes are delayed. By solving this problem, the Society would be better equipped to safeguard marine ecosystems and respond to temperature-driven threats. 
Our temperature monitoring system provides The Marine Conservation Society with an affordable and efficient tool for continuous water temperature tracking. The system's real-time data display and logging capabilities support analysis and informed decision-making. This enhances our client’s ability to address marine conservation challenges and adapt to environmental changes.
